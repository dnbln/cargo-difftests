# Do either one of the following:
# 1. Uncomment the line in rustflags to use the `-C instrument-coverage` flag.
# 2. (Recommended) Uncomment the lines for `build.rustc-wrapper` and `build.rustc-workspace-wrapper`
# to use the `rustc-wrapper-difftests` wrapper.
# This will enable instrumentation-based code coverage before calling rustc,
# but it does so only for workspace packages.
# This has the effect that the code coverage is only computed for the workspace
# packages, and not for the dependencies.
# This option is recommended because it is faster and produces less output.
#
# It never adds the `-C instrument-coverage` flag to the rustflags if
# `--cfg cargo_difftests` is not specified.
